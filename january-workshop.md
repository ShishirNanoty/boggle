# January Python Workshop
At the January 17th Python workshop we are going to work on adding some features to a simple Boggle game. You will need to bring a laptop 
to participate. In the best case you will get through all the setup before arriving, but if you have trouble with any steps, do what you can and 
we will help get you up to speed.

1. Setup Python. Get Python installed on your laptop if you haven't already.
1. Get the source code. The best way to do this is forking the repository on GitHub, but if you don't have a GitHub account you can download the source.  Here's the basic steps for both:
 - Best case - if you have a GitHub account, fork my Boggle repo: https://github.com/albertcrowley/boggle
 - Alternatively you can download the source code in a zip file: [master.zip](https://github.com/albertcrowley/boggle/archive/master.zip)

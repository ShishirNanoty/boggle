# January Python Workshop
At the 6pm January 17th Python workshop we are going to work on adding some features to a simple Boggle game. If you are an intermediate or expert Python user, feel free to come at 6pm to talk tech or, if needed, help out the folks here for the workshop.

You will need to bring a laptop to participate. In the best case you will get through all the setup before arriving, but if you have trouble with any steps, do what you can and 
we will help get you up to speed.

1. Setup Python. Get Python 2.x installed on your laptop if you haven't already.
1. Get the source code. The best way to do this is forking the repository on GitHub, but if you don't have a GitHub account you can download the source.  Here's the basic steps for both:
	1. Best case - if you have a GitHub account, fork my Boggle repo: https://github.com/albertcrowley/boggle
	1. Alternatively you can download the source code in a zip file: [master.zip](https://github.com/albertcrowley/boggle/archive/master.zip)
1. Try to run the Boggle game to make sure you have everthing setup properly
1. Download some kind of code editor if you don't have one already. I really like [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) which has a 30 day free trial. If you want something simple and free, try [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
1. If you want, review the [open issues](https://github.com/albertcrowley/boggle/issues) for the repo. For the workshop, everyone can pick an issue to work on. If you get stuck anywhere we'll team up to solve it.
